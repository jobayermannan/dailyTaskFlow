- **Practice**: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (Heaps/Priority Queues).

### 4.3 Graphs
- **Focus**: Graph theory basics, DFS, BFS.
- **Practice**: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) (Graphs).

## Advanced Algorithms
### 5.1 Greedy Algorithms
- **Focus**: Greedy approach for problems like Activity Selection and Coin Change.
- **Practice**: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (Greedy Algorithms).

### 5.2 Dynamic Programming (DP)
- **Focus**: Memoization and tabulation techniques.
- **Practice**: Focus on medium and hard DP problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (Dynamic Programming).

### 5.3 System Design and Optimization
- **Focus**: Designing scalable systems and optimizing algorithms.
- **Resources**: [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).

## Competitive Programming
### 6.1 Practice on Competitive Platforms
- **Focus**: Join contests to improve problem-solving speed.
- **Platforms**: [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/).

### 6.2 Time and Space Complexity
- **Focus**: Understanding and optimizing time and space complexity.
- **Practice**: Solve complexity-based problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).

## General Tips for DSA Mastery
- **Understand the Concepts First**: Don’t rush into solving problems without fully understanding the data structure or algorithm.
- **Visualize the Problem**: Before implementing a solution, try to visualize it.
- **Track Time and Complexity**: Always think about the time and memory usage of your solution.
- **Practice Consistently**: Dedicate a fixed amount of time each day to solving problems.

By following this roadmap, you’ll build a strong foundation in both DSA and JavaScript. Use platforms like LeetCode, CodeWars, and HackerRank to implement and solve problems step by step as you progress from beginner to expert.
