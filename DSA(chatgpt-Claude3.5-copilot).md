For each step, I recommend the following approach:

1. Learn the concept (using resources like books, online courses, or YouTube tutorials)
2. Implement the data structure or algorithm in JavaScript
3. Solve related problems on the suggested platforms

Here's a simple JavaScript implementation of a binary search tree to get you started:

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

class BinarySearchTree {
    constructor() {
        this.root = null;
    }

    insert(value) {
        const newNode = new Node(value);
        if (this.root === null) {
            this.root = newNode;
            return this;
        }
        let current = this.root;
        while (true) {
            if (value === current.value) return undefined;
            if (value < current.value) {
                if (current.left === null) {
                    current.left = newNode;
                    return this;
                }
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                if (current.right === null) {
                    current.right = newNode;
                    return this;
                }
                current = current.right;
            }
        }
    }

    find(value) {
        if (this.root === null) return false;
        let current = this.root,
            found = false;
        while (current && !found) {
            if (value < current.value) {
                current = current.left;
            } else if (value > current.value) {
                current = current.right;
            } else {
                found = true;
            }
        }
        if (!found) return undefined;
        return current;
    }
}

// Usage
const tree = new BinarySearchTree();
tree.insert(10);
tree.insert(5);
tree.insert(13);
tree.insert(11);
tree.insert(2);
tree.insert(16);

console.log(tree.find(11)); // Node { value: 11, left: null, right: null }
console.log(tree.find(99)); // undefined
```

Remember, consistency is key when learning DSA. Try to solve at least one problem daily and gradually increase the difficulty as you become more comfortable with the concepts. Good luck with your learning journey!
