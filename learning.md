# Algorithm Script

## Introduction
This document outlines the steps to create a basic algorithm script.

## Steps

1. **Define the Problem**
	- Clearly state the problem you are trying to solve.

2. **Plan the Algorithm**
	- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
	- Outline the logic and flow of the algorithm.

3. **Write Pseudocode**
	- Draft the algorithm in pseudocode to visualize the steps.

4. **Implement the Algorithm**
	- Translate the pseudocode into actual code using your preferred programming language.

5. **Test the Algorithm**
	- Run tests to ensure the algorithm works as expected.
	- Debug and optimize as necessary.

## Example

### Problem
Find the maximum number in a list of integers.

### Pseudocode
```
1. Initialize max to the first element of the list.
2. For each element in the list:
	a. If the element is greater than max:
		i. Set max to the element.
3. Return max.
```

### Implementation (Python)
```python
def find_max(numbers):
	 if not numbers:
		  return None
	 max_num = numbers[0]
	 for num in numbers:
		  if num > max_num:
				max_num = num
	 return max_num

# Example usage
numbers = [3, 5, 7, 2, 8]
print(find_max(numbers))  # Output: 8
```

### Testing
- Test with different lists of integers.
- Test with edge cases (e.g., empty list, list with one element).

## Conclusion
Following these steps will help you create a structured and efficient algorithm script.
